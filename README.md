## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction  
Predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning classification models. Includes a Streamlit app for interactive survival predictions based on passenger details.

### 2. Movie Rating Prediction  
Predicts IMDb ratings for Indian movies using regression models. Features EDA visualizations and a Streamlit app for real-time rating predictions based on movie attributes.

### 3. Credit Card Fraud Detection  
Detects fraudulent credit card transactions using classification models on imbalanced datasets. Includes preprocessing to handle imbalance, model training, and evaluation scripts.
## Status
🚧 Task3 is currently under development and the full code and results will be uploaded soon. Stay tuned!

## ⚙️ How to Use Each Project

Each project follows this general workflow:

1. **Navigate to the project folder**  
cd <Project_Folder>

2. **Install Python dependencies**  
pip install -r Requirments.txt

3. **Run exploratory data analysis and visualizations (optional)**  
python visualization.py

4. **Train the machine learning model (if not pre-trained)**  
python train_model.py

5. **Run the interactive Streamlit app**  
streamlit run app.py

6. **Access the app locally at:**  
`http://localhost:8501/`
